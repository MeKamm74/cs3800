Assignment 1: Bash Script
-------------------------

This is the first Bash script I have ever written. It's quite simple, and consists of 3 parts.

Part one prints the tree of the current process.
Part two prints out a list of all current users.
Part three prints out a list of all th eprocesses being run by a given user.
